    XIV - Love and Folly.<br>
  Love bears a world of mystery - <br>

<br>  His arrows, quiver, torch, and infancy:
<br>
<br>  ’Tis not a trifling work to sound
<br>
<br>  A sea of science so profound:
<br>
<br>  And, hence, t’ explain it all to-day
<br>
<br>  Is not my aim; but, in my simple way,
<br>
<br>  To show how that blind archer lad
<br>
<br>  (And he a god!) came by the loss of sight,
<br>
<br>  And eke what consequence the evil had,
<br>
<br>  Or good, perhaps, if named aright —
<br>
<br>  A point I leave the lover to decide,
<br>
<br>  As fittest judge, who hath the matter tried.
<br>
<br>  Together on a certain day,
<br>
<br>  Said Love and Folly were at play:
<br>
<br>  The former yet enjoy’d his eyes.
<br>
<br>  Dispute arose. Love thought it wise
<br>
<br>  Before the council of the gods to go,
<br>
<br>  Where both of them by birth held stations;
<br>
<br>  But Folly, in her lack of patience,
<br>
<br>  Dealt on his forehead such a blow
<br>
<br>  As seal’d his orbs to all the light of heaven.
<br>
<br>  Now Venus claim’d that vengeance should be given.
<br>
<br>  And by what force of tears yourselves may guess
<br>
<br>  The woman and the mother sought redress.
<br>
<br>  The gods were deafen’d with her cries —
<br>
<br>  Jove, Nemesis, the stern assize
<br>
<br>  Of Orcus, — all the gods, in short,
<br>
<br>  From whom she might the boon extort.
<br>
<br>  The enormous wrong she well portray’d —
<br>
<br>  Her son a wretched groper made,
<br>
<br>  An ugly staff his steps to aid!
<br>
<br>  For such a crime, it would appear,
<br>
<br>  No punishment could be severe:
<br>
<br>  The damage, too, must be repair’d.
<br>
<br>  The case maturely weigh’d and cast,
<br>
<br>  The public weal with private squared:
<br>
<br>  Poor Folly was condemn’d at last,
<br>
<br>  By judgment of the court above,
<br>
<br>  To serve for aye as guide to Love.
