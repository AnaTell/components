    XIV - Love and Folly.
  Love bears a world of mystery -

  His arrows, quiver, torch, and infancy:

  ’Tis not a trifling work to sound

  A sea of science so profound:

  And, hence, t’ explain it all to-day

  Is not my aim; but, in my simple way,

  To show how that blind archer lad

  (And he a god!) came by the loss of sight,

  And eke what consequence the evil had,

  Or good, perhaps, if named aright —

  A point I leave the lover to decide,

  As fittest judge, who hath the matter tried.

  Together on a certain day,

  Said Love and Folly were at play:

  The former yet enjoy’d his eyes.

  Dispute arose. Love thought it wise

  Before the council of the gods to go,

  Where both of them by birth held stations;

  But Folly, in her lack of patience,

  Dealt on his forehead such a blow

  As seal’d his orbs to all the light of heaven.

  Now Venus claim’d that vengeance should be given.

  And by what force of tears yourselves may guess

  The woman and the mother sought redress.

  The gods were deafen’d with her cries —

  Jove, Nemesis, the stern assize

  Of Orcus, — all the gods, in short,

  From whom she might the boon extort.

  The enormous wrong she well portray’d —

  Her son a wretched groper made,

  An ugly staff his steps to aid!

  For such a crime, it would appear,

  No punishment could be severe:

  The damage, too, must be repair’d.

  The case maturely weigh’d and cast,

  The public weal with private squared:

  Poor Folly was condemn’d at last,

  By judgment of the court above,

  To serve for aye as guide to Love.26

  <p> XV. — The Raven, the Gazelle, the Tortoise, and the Rat.
  To Madame De La Sablière.28
  A temple I reserved you in my rhyme:

  It might not be completed but with time.

  Already its endurance I had grounded

  Upon this charming art, divinely founded;

  And on the name of that divinity

  For whom its adoration was to be.

  These words I should have written o’er its gate —

  TO IRIS IS THIS PALACE CONSECRATE;

  Not her who served the queen divine;

  For Juno’s self, and he who crown’d her bliss,

  Had thought it for their dignity, I wis,

  To bear the messages of mine.

  Within the dome the apotheosis

  Should greet th’ enraptured sight —

  All heaven, in pomp and order meet,

  Conducting Iris to her seat

  Beneath a canopy of light!

  The walls would amply serve to paint her life, —

  A matter sweet, indeed, but little rife

  In those events, which, order’d by the Fates,

  Cause birth, or change, or overthrow of states.

  The innermost should hold her image, —

  Her features, smiles, attractions there, —

  Her art of pleasing without care, —

  Her loveliness, that’s sure of homage.

  Some mortals, kneeling at her feet,29 —

  Earth’s noblest heroes, — should be seen;

  Ay, demigods, and even gods, I ween:

  (The worshipp’d of the world thinks meet,

  Sometimes her altar to perfume.)

  Her eyes, so far as that might be,

  Her soul’s rich jewel should illume;

  Alas! but how imperfectly!

  For could a heart that throbb’d to bless

  Its friends with boundless tenderness, —

  Or could that heaven-descended mind

  Which, in its matchless beauty, join’d

  The strength of man with woman’s grace, —

  Be given to sculptor to express?

  O Iris, who canst charm the soul —

  Nay, bind it with supreme control, —

  Whom as myself I can but love, —

  (Nay, not that word: as I’m a man,

  Your court has placed it under ban,

  And we’ll dismiss it,) pray approve

  My filling up this hasty plan!

  This sketch has here received a place,

  A simple anecdote to grace,

  Where friendship shows so sweet a face,

  That in its features you may find

  Somewhat accordant to your mind.

  Not that the tale may kings beseem;

  But he who winneth your esteem

  Is not a monarch placed above

  The need and influence of love,

  But simple mortal, void of crown,

  That would for friends his life lay down —

  Than which I know no friendlier act.

  Four animals, in league compact,

  Are now to give our noble race

  A useful lesson in the case.

  Rat, raven, tortoise, and gazelle,

  Once into firmest friendship fell.

  ’Twas in a home unknown to man

  That they their happiness began.

  But safe from man there’s no retreat:

  Pierce you the loneliest wood,

  Or dive beneath the deepest flood,

  Or mount you where the eagles brood, —

  His secret ambuscade you meet.

  The light gazelle, in harmless play,

  Amused herself abroad one day,

  When, by mischance, her track was found

  And follow’d by the baying hound —

  That barbarous tool of barbarous man —

  From which far, far away she ran.

  At meal-time to the others

  The rat observed, — ‘My brothers,

  How happens it that we

  Are met to-day but three?

  Is Miss Gazelle so little steady?

  Hath she forgotten us already?’

  Out cried the tortoise at the word, —

  ‘Were I, as Raven is, a bird,

  I’d fly this instant from my seat,

  And learn what accident, and where,

  Hath kept away our sister fair, —

  Our sister of the flying feet;

  For of her heart, dear rat,

  It were a shame to doubt of that.’

  The raven flew;

  He spied afar, — the face he knew, —

  The poor gazelle entangled in a snare,

  In anguish vainly floundering there.

  Straight back he turn’d, and gave the alarm;

  For to have ask’d the sufferer now,

  The why and wherefore, when and how,

  She had incurr’d so great a harm, —

  And lose in vain debate

  The turning-point of fate,

  As would the master of a school, —

  He was by no means such a fool.30

  On tidings of so sad a pith,

  The three their council held forthwith.

  By two it was the vote

  To hasten to the spot

  Where lay the poor gazelle.

  ‘Our friend here in his shell,

  I think, will do as well

  To guard the house,’ the raven said;

  ‘For, with his creeping pace,

  When would he reach the place?

  Not till the deer were dead.’

  Eschewing more debate,

  They flew to aid their mate,

  That luckless mountain roe.

  The tortoise, too, resolved to go.

  Behold him plodding on behind,

  And plainly cursing in his mind,

  The fate that left his legs to lack,

  And glued his dwelling to his back.

  The snare was cut by Rongemail,

  (For so the rat they rightly hail).

  Conceive their joy yourself you may.

  Just then the hunter came that way,

  And, ‘Who hath filch’d my prey?’

  Cried he, upon the spot

  Where now his prey was not. —

  A hole hid Rongemail;

  A tree the bird as well;

  The woods, the free gazelle.

  The hunter, well nigh mad,

  To find no inkling could be had,

  Espied the tortoise in his path,

  And straightway check’d his wrath.

  ‘Why let my courage flag,

  Because my snare has chanced to miss?

  I’ll have a supper out of this.’

  He said, and put it in his bag.

  And it had paid the forfeit so,

  Had not the raven told the roe,

  Who from her covert came,

  Pretending to be lame.

  The man, right eager to pursue,

  Aside his wallet threw,

  Which Rongemail took care

  To serve as he had done the snare;

  Thus putting to an end

  The hunter’s supper on his friend.

  ’Tis thus sage Pilpay’s tale I follow.

  Were I the ward of golden-hair’d Apollo,

  It were, by favour of that god, easy —

  And surely for your sake —

  As long a tale to make

  As is the Iliad or Odyssey.

  Grey Rongemail the hero’s part should play,

  Though each would be as needful in his way.

  He of the mansion portable awoke

  Sir Raven by the words he spoke,

  To act the spy, and then the swift express.

  The light gazelle alone had had th’ address

  The hunter to engage, and furnish time

  For Rongemail to do his deed sublime.

  Thus each his part perform’d. Which wins the prize?

  The heart, so far as in my judgment lies.31
